NAME

  Params::Check::Item - checks the type or value of an item at any point
  during execution

VERSION

  Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS

  Params::Check::Items exports a bunch of utility functions for checking the
  values of items through Carp::Assert. It is different than other parameter
  checking modules since it has low configuration overhead and you are
  expected to check one parameter at a time, instead of creating a giant hash
  of all the valid values for all the parameters, such as Params::Check.
  All exported functions optionally take in a message parameter at the end
  that is displayed if Carp::Assert fails. 

  If you would like to disable the checks, you must set the environment 
  variable PARAMS_CHECK_ITEM_OFF=1. Note that this can be toggled on and
  off during runtime.

  An example:

      use Params::Check::Item;
      sub myFunc {
        my ($row, $col, $matrix) = @_[0..2];
        checkIndex($row, "row not an index");
        checkIndex($col, "col not an index");
        checkClass($matrix, "My::Matrix::Type", "invalid matrix");
        $matrix->get($row, $col);
      }

SUBROUTINES

  All exported subroutines take in an optional string message, [MSG], 
  to display on failure. Addtionally, the subroutines will not perform the
  check if the environment variable PARAMS_CHECK_ITEM_OFF is set.

  checkNumber NUM,[MSG]

    checks that NUM is numeric type

  checkInteger NUM,[MSG]

    checks that NUM is an integer

  checkIndex NUM,[MSG]

    checks that NUM is a valid index (e.g., 0,1,2,3...)

  checkClass OBJECT,CLASSNAME,[MSG]

    checks that OBJECT is a blessed object from class of name CLASSNAME

  checkNumEQ NUM1,NUM2,[MSG]

    checks that NUM1 == NUM2

  checkNumNEQ NUM1,NUM2,[MSG]

    checks that NUM1 != NUM2

  checkNumLT NUM1,NUM2,[MSG]
   
    checks that NUM1 < NUM2

  checkNumLTE NUM1,NUM2,[MSG]

    checks that NUM1 <= NUM2

  checkOneOf ITEM,ARRAYREF,[MSG]

    checks that simple item ITEM is present in the array referenced by
    ARRAYREF. This simply performs string comparison. It must be an exact
    match with one of the items in the array to pass.

  head2 checkImpl [MSG]

    simply fails and says "Not Implemented: [MSG]". good for stubbing out
    functions.
